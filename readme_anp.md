# Analysing Fuel Prices in Brazil
## by Rodrigo Brust


## Dataset

> This is notebook is my very first analysis after Udacity Nanodegree. I'm still getting to know around data analysis challenges.

> This dataset is from my homeland, Brazil, provided by National Petroleum Agency.

> We're going to take a look in a very simple analysis. It's just a warp-up for upcoming projects.

#### Investigation Overview

> The main goal of this investigation is to analyze the increase of fuel prices in Brazil. It is known that Brazil produces a lot of oil, but still gas price it' very expensive. Furthermore, all political and economical crises makes the prices go higher and higher. In here, you'll see how the prices shifted from 2004 to 2019.

#### Dataset Overview

> The dataset was downloaded from [Conjunto de Dados Abertos](https://dados.gov.br/dataseta) website. In the CSV file there are a lot of information, such as dates, states, macroregion, mean price for selling, mean price for distribuition, number of gas stations observed, and many other more variables.

## Summary of Findings

> Gasoline is the most expensive fuel in Brazil.

> From 2004 to 2014 the prices kept controlled, but from 2015 to 2019 we can see how it skyrocketed. This have many correlations with Brazil's 00s increasing economy, and 10s crisis.

> The states of Norte macroregion have the lowest average of observed gas stations. This might happen due the smaller population compared to other regions, such as Sudeste.

> Ethanol is not derived from oil, that's why is cheaper. But we can see that it had more oscilations in the very first 10 years compared to the oil-based fuels.

> Despite Rio de Janeiro being Brazil's most oil producer, it has one of the highest gasoline prices all over the country.
